## 1. The concept, in five sentences

Compliance data becomes a **graph of nine shallow, globally identified
objects** — documents are just renderings of it. Everything three
national authorities were measured to need — binding force, clauses,
typed parameters and deadlines, membership, aliases, history,
deviations, crosswalks — lives **in the kernel**; everything
framework-specific lives in **registered facets** with machine-checked
schemas and declared semantics; rendering hints live in
**annotations**, invisible to compliance; and the measured majority of
yesterday's extensions (>70 % of counted props) simply **die**,
because they were imitating kernel mechanics. Failures are made
**unrepresentable rather than forbidden** (bound `{param:}` tokens,
identity-addressed tailoring, fail-closed on unknown semantics).
Integrity uses **two digests** — package (the bytes sent) and semantic
(the meaning approved) — so signatures survive legitimate repackaging
while tampering has nowhere to hide. Tools that don't understand
something must **carry it or stop with a reason — never guess**.

```mermaid
graph TD
  REQ["Requirement
statements[]: modality ·
obligated-parties · params · prose"]
  SET["RequirementSet
members + sequence
(nests: taxonomy & baselines)"]
  TAI["Tailoring
selects + identity-addressed ops
(weakening ⇒ Deviation)"]
  MAP["Mapping
source/target ± statement
relationship · provenance"]
  COMP["Component
members · capabilities ·
authorizations[] (identified)"]
  IMPL["Implementation
responsibility · status ·
inherited-from + basis"]
  ASMT["Assessment
facet-typed method · result"]
  FIND["Finding
state · actions[] (due) ·
Deviation"]
  ATT["Attestation
subjects (semantic digests) ·
manifest digest · rendering"]

  SET --> REQ
  SET --> SET
  TAI --> SET
  TAI -->|"stmt-id + param"| REQ
  MAP --> REQ
  COMP --> COMP
  IMPL --> COMP
  IMPL -->|"± stmt-refs"| REQ
  IMPL -->|"basis = authorization-id"| COMP
  ASMT --> COMP
  FIND --> ASMT
  FIND --> REQ
  ATT -.->|"binds"| REQ
```

Reading keys: the **statement-id** is the shared fine address
(tailoring, shared responsibility, findings, mapping scope all use
it); the **authorization-id** is the boundary currency (every
inheritance edge names the context it leans on — checked link by
link); the **Deviation** is one audited channel at three moments
(tailoring · implementation · finding).

## 2. The files — what actually ships

A publication is a **bundle**: objects, pinned facet schemas,
renderings, one content manifest — and the attestation *beside* the
manifest (nothing signed contains its own signature).

```mermaid
graph TD
  B["bundle/"]
  B --> MF["content-manifest.json
per object: package-digest + semantic-digest
facet-schemas: exact version + digest
renderings: digest"]
  B --> OBJ["objects/*.json — the nine types"]
  B --> SCH["schemas/*.json — facet descriptors"]
  B --> REN["render/*.md|pdf — documents as views"]
  B --> ATT["attestation-*.json + DSSE envelope
(beside the manifest, excluded from it)"]
```

Concretely, in `semantic-core-example-bundle/` (real computed
digests; closed references):

| Concept | Example file |
|---|---|
| Requirement — full / minimal / deadline | `objects/req-konf-14-1.json` · `req-ism-1234.json` · `req-iec-cso-iir.json` |
| RequirementSet — nested + multi-authority | `objects/set-crypto.json` · `set-baseline.json` |
| Tailoring — monotone ops, no Deviation needed | `objects/tailoring-elevated.json` |
| Mapping — third-party crosswalk | `objects/mapping-konf-ism.json` |
| Component — perimeter / consumer | `objects/component-paas.json` · `component-acme-saas.json` |
| Implementation — shared, inherited + basis | `objects/implementation-acme-konf.json` |
| Assessment / Finding (+Deviation) | `objects/assessment-2026q3.json` · `finding-017.json` |
| Attestation · Manifest · Facet schemas · Rendering | `attestation-acme-2026.json` · `content-manifest.json` · `schemas/*` · `render/authorization-summary.md` |

## 3. The workflow — end to end

Five roles, one bundle, no email archaeology:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  autonumber
  participant AU as Authority
  participant PR as Provider (CSO)
  participant AS as Assessor
  participant AO as Authorizing Official
  participant VE as Verifier (any Portable tool)

  AU->>AU: mint namespace · write statements (modality, params)
  AU->>AU: sets (baselines, taxonomy) · tailorings · facet schemas
  AU->>PR: publish bundle (manifest: both digests, pinned schemas)
  PR->>PR: components + identified authorizations
  PR->>PR: implementation edges (statement-refs, inherited-from + basis)
  PR->>AS: bundle + evidence refs
  AS->>AS: assessment (criteria facet) → findings · actions · deviations
  AS->>AO: assessed bundle + rendering (pinned template)
  AO->>AO: attestation = subject semantic digests + manifest digest + rendering digest → DSSE sign
  AO->>VE: attested bundle (attestation beside manifest)
  VE->>VE: sealed validation — package digests · refs via manifest · facet schemas · fail-closed gate
  VE-->>AO: verdict — Full Match / Semantic Match / fail (with printed rationale)
```

Step-by-step in prose: the **Authority** authors requirements as
identified statements, expresses membership and variants as Sets and
Tailorings (never inline copies), publishes framework semantics as
schema-pinned facets, and ships a manifest with both digests. The
**Provider** models its stack as Components with identified
authorization contexts and states, clause by clause, how each
requirement is met — every inheritance edge naming its legal basis.
The **Assessor** runs criteria-driven Assessments; gaps become
Findings with computable deadlines; dispositions become typed
Deviations. The **AO** signs a rendering whose template is pinned —
the Attestation binds *meaning* (semantic digests), *package state*
(manifest digest), and *paper* (artifact digest) in one object. Any
**Verifier**, offline, replays the whole chain from the bundle alone
— and unknown semantics stop it with a reason instead of a guess.

The verification verdict is deliberately bi-modal:

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
  [*] --> Verify
  state "Full Match — exact package as signed" as FM
  state "Semantic Match — meaning proven, packaging changed (report as such)" as SM
  state "Failed — invalid signature / missing subjects / broken digests" as FA
  Verify --> FM: signature ok · manifest digest matches
  Verify --> SM: signature ok · all subject semantic digests match · manifest digest differs
  Verify --> FA: anything else
  FM --> [*]
  SM --> [*]
  FA --> [*]
```

Semantic Match is information, not injury: someone stripped chrome or
repackaged in transit — lawful, visible, and provably unable to have
touched normative content (templates may read annotations only as
chrome).

## 4. One paragraph of "why", for the skeptic

The old model spent its complexity budget on infrastructure — a
meta-language, eight deep document models, a resolution algebra —
and disclaimed meaning; the measured result was 22,000+ annotation
props across three national corpora, 216 invisible defects inside
schema-valid documents, and a flagship program routing around the
standard entirely. This architecture inverts the spend: boring
infrastructure (one serialization, shallow objects, a half-page
resolver), all sophistication in the semantic contract — and every
design decision above traces to something an authority actually
shipped. *When in doubt, count.*
