# OSCAL Semantic Core (working name) — "Kernel + Registered Facets"
## v0.5 — Corrected Specification with Decision Register and Normative Shapes
### 2026-07-18

**Status.** A **well-supported architecture hypothesis** with a corrected,
internally consistent specification. Five adversarial review passes and one
validating pass have been adjudicated (changelog IV.6). The executable proof
gate — full-corpus converters, schemas, measured complexity — moves honestly
to **v0.6** (IV.5): the passes showed the specification had holes that had to
close *before* code, and pretending otherwise would violate this project's
own evidence-tier rule. Comparison baseline throughout: **OSCAL 1.2.2**
(current NIST line, eight models including the Control Mapping Model
introduced March 2026 with v1.2.1) — verified against NIST reference pages;
an earlier reviewer claim that no 1.2.x line exists was a knowledge-cutoff
artifact.

**North star (session directive, governs every verdict):** *more simple ·
closer to the needs of the customers · no more props · less need for custom
Metaschema extensions or bespoke JSON.* Every decision below cites at least
one measured customer need; the companion **Decision Rationale Register**
scores each decision explicitly against customer / simplicity / reduced
complexity.

**Lineage.** v0.1 → pass 1 → v0.2 → pass 2 + census r1/r2 → v0.3 → passes
3 (SOL) + 4 (H) → v0.4 → passes 5 (Grok, validating), 6 (P6-F1…4),
7 (P7-B1…4, gaps, mapping), 8 (P8-E1…4, gaps) → **v0.5** → v0.6 cycle:
review rounds 1–2 (adjudicated, F.6/F.7) + P9 twin adversarial runs
(adjudicated, F.8).

# Part I — The Evidence Base

## 1. Method

Admitted sources of design authority — every normative element traces to at
least one: (1) **measured 1.x failures** (F1–F10); (2) **adjudicated
adversarial findings** (G, SOL/H, P6/P7/P8 — rejections documented);
(3) **the three-authority census** (ISM v2026.06.18 · BSI GS++/MS-TLS
2026-07 · FedRAMP CR26 v2026.07.14.01).

Principles: **failures unrepresentable, not forbidden** (the 216
pseudo-placeholders inside schema-valid BSI documents remain the standing
proof); **complexity-budget reallocation** (1.x spent the budget on
infrastructure — RFC-0024 records the verdict: 100+ Rev5 authorizations in
2025, zero OSCAL); **claims follow evidence tier** (measured / designed-for /
hypothesized, always labeled).

## 2. Corpus and adopter scope (corrected per P7/P8)

Authoritative machine-readable publications are one category; conversions
and mappings are another. The defensible scope statement:

> The design targets official machine-readable publications from **NIST**
> (800-53, 800-171, CSF 2.0 in OSCAL 1.2.2), **BSI** (Stand-der-Technik /
> Grundschutz++ catalogs — not the entire traditional Kompendium), **ASD**
> (ISM OSCAL releases), **CSA** (CCM v4 OSCAL bundle — a conversion
> artifact, version to be re-checked at corpus time), **SCF** (official
> OSCAL JSON — pinned to OSCAL **1.0.4**, itself a data point for version
> fragmentation), and **FedRAMP CR26** (bespoke JSON, not OSCAL); plus the
> **CIS** OSCAL corpus (repository status disputed between passes —
> archived vs. maintained v8.1 — verification item, treated as test corpus
> either way); plus **licensed or independently modeled targets** for
> ISO/IEC 27001/27002 and PCI DSS, which have **no official OSCAL
> publications** and must never be attributed as such.

The census proof gate (v0.6) covers the three measured corpora: ISM, BSI,
CR26. Everything beyond is *designed-for*.

## 3. The convergence table

Decision rule: **3-way convergence → kernel; real but framework-shaped →
stdlib facet; workaround for a missing kernel mechanism → structurally
dead.** (Unchanged from v0.4 except the rows noted; full table retained for
self-containment.)

# Part II — The Decision Register

Format: **Decision → Evidence → Rationale → Pros → Cons → Rejected.**
Stable numbering; `(rev. v0.5 — finding)` marks changes since v0.4.

## D1 — One serialization: JSON; prose = CommonMark + GFM tables, no raw HTML.
Unchanged from v0.4. Evidence: CR26 is JSON-canonical; ISM triple-publishing
is an agency tax; the fabricated "#2118 wanted tables" justification remains
documented and discarded — GFM tables stand on the parameter-matrix reality
of compliance prose. Data-bearing tables belong in typed fields; prose
tables are narrative. Rejected: normative XML, YAML conformance, raw HTML.

## D2 — Identity: authority URIs, string-compared, never resolved; `label` + `aliases[]`; **alias vs. lineage split.** *(rev. v0.5 — P7-B4)*
**Decision.** As v0.4, with the supersession mechanism split into two
relations with different powers:

- `canonical-alias` — **identity equivalence**, authority-asserted, only for
  rebrands of the *same* content (old URI ⇄ new URI). Validators substitute
  freely.
- `replaces[] {ref, relationship: revised | split-from | merged-into |
  renamed}` — **lineage only**. Never automatic substitution: a revision,
  split, or merge is a different object with history, and auto-substituting
  it would silently corrupt implementations, findings, attestations,
  mappings, and tailorings.

**Evidence.** BSI twin-catalog collisions; the deleted FedRAMP registry
(locator rot); ×1,219/×188/legacy alias practice across all three; P7's
demonstration that "supersedes = equivalence" is unsafe for revised content.
**Rejected.** URN scheme; UUID-primary identity; one conflated supersedes
relation (v0.4 — corrected).

## D3 — **Content manifest**, sealed mode, two integrity domains, deterministic canonical form. *(rev. v0.5 — P7-B1, P6-F3, P8-E4, P7-G3/G5)*
**Decision.**

1. The **content manifest** lists all substantive objects and renderings
   with **both digests each** (`package-digest` over delivered bytes,
   annotations included; `semantic-digest` = SHA-256 over JCS of the object
   minus `annotations`). **Attestations and signature envelopes are
   excluded from the content manifest by definition** — they live beside
   it (a transport manifest MAY list both but is never the signed
   structure). This dissolves the manifest↔attestation hash cycle P7-B1
   proved: nothing signed contains its own signature.
2. **Sealed mode** remains a Core conformance requirement: full validation
   with zero network access, resolution via the manifest only.
3. **JCS pre-normalization (P6-F3):** before JCS serialization, all
   structurally optional arrays/objects containing zero elements MUST be
   omitted. Normative test vectors cover this and the permitted number
   domain.
4. **`decimal` is a canonical decimal string** (lexically defined scale/
   precision), never an IEEE-754 number — two tools MUST derive identical
   digests and values (P7-G on decimals). **Canonical form (rev. v0.6 cycle
   — backlog #27):** no leading zeros (`01.5` is rejected — it is a
   non-canonical spelling of one value); scale IS significant, so `1.5` and
   `1.50` are DISTINCT values by design (the lexical form defines the scale)
   and their differing digests are correct, not a divergence. Re-scaling a
   value is forbidden. Schema pattern: `^-?(0|[1-9][0-9]*)(\.[0-9]+)?$`.
5. **Facet pinning and bundle composition (P8-E4/P7-G5):** manifests pin
   exact facet versions + digests; objects may cite the major line. Registry
   semver policy makes minor versions backward-compatible **normatively**;
   composing two bundles pinning different minors of one major line
   resolves deterministically to the highest pinned minor with both
   payload sets re-validated — incompatibility is a reported error, never a
   silent pick.

**Evidence.** Air-gapped estates; registry link-rot; P7's fixed-point proof;
P6's omitted-vs-empty hash fragmentation; the two-digest necessity
established in v0.4 (H1/SOL-9) now made cycle-free.
**Rejected.** Attestation inside the signed manifest (no fixed point);
single digest domain (either breaks stripping or enables the H1 forgery);
IEEE decimals (canonicalization hazard).

## D4 — Nine shallow kernel types; documents are renderings.
*(count updated by D20)* Requirement, RequirementSet, Tailoring, Component,
Implementation, Assessment, Finding, Attestation, **Mapping** — shallow,
typed, referenced; no parts, no document tree, no positional semantics.
Documents are L4 renderings. Evidence unchanged (the #2118/#2112 class; 998
flat BSI controls as fossil record; **CR26 is documents-as-views in
production**). The type-count dogma is formally retired (P7's closing
argument accepted): **semantic completeness beats winning the type-count
argument** — and the ledger claim becomes *nine shallow types replace eight
deep document models* (1.2.2's, including its March-2026 Mapping Model).

## D5 — Component (absorbs System); **identified authorization contexts**; edge-local inductive boundary rule. *(rev. v0.5 — P7-G on authorization scoping)*
**Decision.** As v0.4, with authorization contexts made addressable:

```json
"authorizations": [
  { "id": "https://cso.example/auth/fedramp-high",
    "authority-ref": "https://ns.fedramp.gov/party/jab",
    "scope-label": "FedRAMP High P-ATO",
    "includes": [ {"component-ref": "…"}, {"component-ref": "…"} ] } ]
```

`includes[]` scopes which members belong to this context (default: the
component's full members graph). Absence of `authorizations` remains
**structurally silent** — never a negative assertion. The boundary rule is
unchanged and edge-local: every `inherited-from` edge whose target declares
any authorization MUST carry `basis-ref` — which now points at a specific
**authorization id**, so a service holding both a JAB P-ATO and an agency
ATO can be inherited against the right one. Multi-hop chains remain covered
by induction; D14's one-hop budget intact.
**Rejected (recorded).** Boolean flag (v0.3), defaulted boolean (v0.4 →
dead), separate System type, multi-hop traversal.

## D6 — One `Implementation` edge (comp-def + SSP implemented-requirements unified).
Unchanged: `{component-ref, requirement-ref, statement-refs[]?,
satisfied-by[] (capability-ref | inherited-from{component-ref, basis-ref →
authorization id}), responsibility: provider|customer|shared,
parameter-bindings, status, evidence-refs[], deviations[]}`. Evidence: the
public PR #8 retreat; historical Rev4 enums mapping 1:1. Per-clause
responsibility via `statement-refs` is how shared responsibility actually
works.

## D7 — Attestation: content-manifest binding, **bi-modal verification**, verification contract, provenance map. *(rev. v0.5 — P7-B1 + P6-F1 merged)*
**Decision.**
`{subject-semantic-digests[], content-manifest-digest, rendering
{artifact-digest, media-type, template-ref (pinned), renderer}, signer,
timestamp, envelope-ref, provenance-map-ref?}` — the attestation binds the
**content-manifest digest** (which covers every object's package- and
semantic-digest at signing time) and is itself outside that manifest (D3).
Verification is a **normative two-state machine**:

1. **Full Match** — signature valid, content-manifest digest matches the
   delivered bundle: exact packaging and presentation state proven.
2. **Semantic Match** — signature valid, all `subject-semantic-digests`
   match, but the content-manifest digest does not (e.g., annotations
   legitimately stripped, bundle re-packaged): **compliance content proven;
   packaging altered in transit** — reported as such, never as failure and
   never as Full.

The stdlib DSSE profile remains normative about envelope location, exact
signed digest set, signer identity, trust roots, timestamps,
expiry/revocation, and subjects-in-bundle completeness. Template rule
unchanged: annotations may influence only non-normative chrome. Optional
provenance map: statement-id/object-id → rendering anchor.
**Rejected.** Hashing annotation-inclusive semantic payloads; P6's binary as
originally posed — the manifest split plus bi-modal states preserves *both*
the anti-tamper guarantee and the stripping right.

## D8 — `Deviation` sub-object.
Unchanged: `{type (code system), state (investigating → pending → approved |
withdrawn), rationale, approver-ref, opened, refs[]}` on Implementation,
Finding, Tailoring. Evidence: four identical historical state machines; CR26
`corrective_actions`; BSI Abweichungspraxis. Its role widens in D13: it is
the audited channel for *every* recognized weakening, not only modality.

## D9 — Statements: identified collection; **normative modality order**; obligated-parties; **elapsed vs. calendar durations**; parameter algebra. *(rev. v0.5 — P8-E2, P7-G on calendars/decimal)* *(rev. v0.6 cycle — R1 #1)*
**Decision.** As v0.4 (`statements[] {id, modality, obligated-parties[],
parameters[], prose{lang}}`), completed where the passes proved it
unevaluatable:

**Modality partial order (normative — the lattice `modality-monotonic`
evaluates against):**

```
obligation axis:   unspecified < may < should < must
prohibition axis:  unspecified < should-not < must-not
restriction:       may < may-only          (a permission narrowed is stronger)
incomparable:      {may-only vs should/must} · {any obligation vs any prohibition}
```

`set-modality` without a Deviation is permitted **iff** new ≥ old in this
partial order. Axis reversals (e.g., may → must-not) and all incomparable
moves are never monotone ⇒ Deviation. Design note recorded for the German
customer: **DARF NUR** (may-only) is a restriction — stronger than may,
incomparable with must — exactly as BSI Verbindlichkeitssprache treats it;
the lattice is the first machine-checkable encoding of that distinction.

**Durations split (calendar honesty):**

- `elapsed-duration {num, unit ∈ seconds|minutes|hours}` — computable
  everywhere.
- `calendar-period {num, unit ∈ days|bizdays|weeks|months|years, calendar-ref?,
  timezone?, cutoff?}` — **representable without context, computable only
  with it**: deadline arithmetic over a calendar-period without a resolvable
  calendar context MUST fail closed with an explained error. CR26's
  `bizdays` is the customer evidence; two conformant tools must never
  compute different deadlines from one value (P7's exact objection).

Scalar algebra otherwise unchanged (`string | integer | decimal(canonical
string, D3) | boolean | date | datetime | uri | code`, containers
`choice | list | range`), with the standing escape: what the algebra cannot
type is a `string` plus a facet — never a schema-in-parameter.

**`label` and `default` (rev. v0.6 cycle — R1 #1).** Every parameter
declaration MAY carry `label` (human display handle — never an identifier,
never compared) and `default` (an advisory value, type-valid against the
declaration). Resolution **never substitutes a default silently**: an
unbound parameter stays unbound — binding happens only through
`set-parameter` (D13) — because silent substitution is the two-diverging-
representations corpse in miniature. The measured customer: BSI parameter
labels ("regelmäßig") and suggested `values[]` on 179 requirements, exiled
to the L2 `param-extras` residue solely because the algebra was two
optional fields too spare; the residue drains at the next converter run.

## D10 — Facets: registered, federated, capability-declared, fail-closed; **private: defined harmless; undeclared registered = dangerous.** *(rev. v0.5 — P6-F4 + P7-G4 merged)* *(rev. v0.6 cycle — R1 #7)*
**Decision.** As v0.4 (Portable/Computable split, `modifies-semantics` ⊆
{assessment, tailoring, selection, rendering}, capability declarations,
normative fail-closed), with the two open edges closed in one consistent
rule pair:

1. **`private:` facets carry `modifies-semantics: []` by definition.** They
   are preserved, never validated, and **ignored by every compliance
   computation** — exactly the annotations discipline with structure.
   Smuggling compliance math into `private:` is self-defeating: conformant
   tools are *required* to look away. No fail-closed abort on sight
   (P6-F4's paradox dissolved); the artifact remains capped below Portable.
2. **A registered facet whose descriptor omits the declaration is treated
   as modifying all four classes** — dangerous-by-default, fail-closed
   everywhere (P7-G4's direction adopted for the registered space). The
   burden is on the publisher to declare harmlessness, not on consumers to
   assume it.

`.well-known` stays discovery-only; identity and trust are manifest pins
(D3). Annotations unchanged.

**Declaration-audit promotions (rev. v0.6 cycle — R1 #8).** Three stdlib
facets promote their `modifies-semantics` declarations to what the corpora
show they actually do: `security-objectives@1` → `[selection]`,
`effectivity@1` → `[selection]`, `reporting-obligation@1` → `[assessment]`
(`cr26/scope@1` already declares `[selection]`). The governing directive:
a tool that cannot handle a facet must stop working on that data —
fail-closed only engages when declarations are honest, and a
semantics-bearing facet declaring `[]` is the silent-ignore corpse
(P7-B3) wearing a conformance badge. Gate-2 schemas ship these
declarations; bundle stubs update at the next converter run.

**Per-clause payload keying (rev. v0.6 cycle — R1 #7).** A facet payload
that addresses individual statements of its host Requirement MUST key those
entries as `by-statement: { <statement-id>: <payload> }`, using ids from
the host's `statements[]`; a key naming no statement of the host is a
validation error (checkable by every Portable tool, no facet knowledge
required). Converter-established across 1,015 statements' payloads in six
facets; normative so that a second independent producer cannot legally
invent a divergent keying and fracture per-clause alignment.
**Rejected.** Uniform fail-closed including `private:` (kills the valve);
uniform trust-the-publisher default (props with extra steps).

## D11 — SP 800-53 as Canonical Reference Facet; `oscal-stdlib`.
Unchanged. The stdlib now also carries the **IR 8477 / OLIR relationship
code system** for D20 and the calendar code systems for D9.

## D12 — The extension surface, complete.
Unchanged in structure (eight stdlib facets high/medium confidence;
`privacy-assessment@1` parked pending Rev5-era verification; framework
facets as an open sanctioned category; annotations; ISM = zero facets). One
addition: **`mapping` is *not* here** — mappings are kernel objects (D20),
precisely so that they cannot regress into relation-string props.

## D13 — Tailoring: bounded selection; identity-addressed operations; **weakening rules per operation**; deterministic resolution. *(rev. v0.5 — P6-F2, P7-B2, P8-E3, P7-U)* *(rev. v0.6 cycle — R1 #2)*
**Decision.** As v0.4 (set-ref or the three bounded predicates; closed
op vocabulary addressed by requirement-ref + statement-id + name), completed:

**Operation-level weakening rules (replacing the overbroad v0.4 claim
"weakening ⇒ Deviation", which P7-B2 correctly showed was only enforced for
modality):**

| Operation | Rule |
|---|---|
| `set-modality` | monotone per the D9 order, else Deviation |
| `set-parameter` | MUST validate against the parameter's declared type / cardinality / choices / range (P6-F2); out-of-bounds only via Deviation. Additionally, an authority MAY declare per parameter `tightening: lower | higher | none`; a change against the declared direction ⇒ Deviation (CR26 deadlines would declare `lower`) |
| `detach-facet` | Deviation when the facet's `modifies-semantics` ≠ [] |
| `replace-prose` | carries `intent: editorial | substantive`; substantive ⇒ Deviation |
| `set-field` | whitelisted non-normative fields only (`title`, `label`, `annotations`) — the whitelist is a schema enum since the P9 cycle; `sequence` struck v0.6 (it lives on Set members, which operations cannot address — backlog #21); anything normative goes through its own operation |
| `attach-facet` | Deviation when the attached facet's `modifies-semantics` ≠ [] (symmetric with detach — B.3) |
| `add-relation` / `remove-relation` | informative edges are free; **removing a `required` edge ⇒ Deviation** (B.3 — dropping a dependency weakens the graph; enforced since backlog #25). Normative cross-framework claims are Mapping objects, D20, with their own lifecycle |
| `excludes` | **selection, never weakening — no Deviation** |

The last row is a documented **rejection of P7-B2's "exclude always
requires Deviation"**: excludes define scope — ISM's five classification
baselines and FedRAMP's classes are *made of* excludes; requiring a
Deviation per exclusion would drown every baseline in thousands of
pseudo-deviations and kill the mechanism that absorbs 5,900+ membership
props. Weakening means softening a *selected* obligation; selection is not
softening. (P7 itself conceded a universal weakening detector is
infeasible; this table is the honest bounded substitute.)

**Deviation duties bind at consumption, not authorship (rev. v0.6 cycle —
R1 #2).** A Deviation records an *implementation's* departure from its
governing resolved set. A Tailoring **published at Authority tier is
itself normative source**: its operations are authorship variance, and the
per-operation Deviation requirements in the table above do not apply to it
— FedRAMP publishing four class variants is not FedRAMP deviating from
FedRAMP. The weakening classification itself is still computed and
reportable (a consumer may always ask "which classes ease the base?" —
CR26's measured answer across 111 class-variant modality moves: zero),
but no Deviation object is required, synthesized, or implied. Consumer-
tier Tailorings keep the full table; the audited-escape channel is theirs.
The measured customer: 29 variant-only CR26 rules + 5 KSI variants whose
converter had to synthesize base prose just to have something to
"deviate" from — ceremony without a wronged party. **Rejected:** a
`variants` carrier on Requirement — authority-published variance is 1-of-3
in the census and its mechanism (Tailoring) already exists, so it fails
the D22 promotion bar on tests 1 and 2.

**The tier anchor — layered (rev. v0.6 cycle — R3 #19; rev 4 at gate
3).** The tier that decides Deviation duties is DERIVED from data,
never stipulated: (1) **authority-claimed** iff the Tailoring's id URI
origin (scheme + host) equals the single origin of the selected
**content** — resolved *through* selected Sets to their member ids
(transitively, D21) and through the operations' `requirement-ref`
targets, never stopping at a wrapper Set's own id: gate 3's CR26
`rev5-odp-overlay` (a FedRAMP-minted Set around NIST controls) proved
the wrapper shortcut launders consumer into authority-claimed, and the
same resolution equally recognizes an authority's own content behind a
foreign-minted wrapper. A predicate select or mixed-origin content
blocks the claim, because tailoring across authorities' content is
consumer work by definition; (2) **authority-proven** iff additionally
(or instead — proof beats prefix) an in-bundle Attestation whose signer
shares the selected content's origin lists the Tailoring among its
subjects with a verifying semantic digest — and, **in verification mode
(gate 4, #24: trusted keys supplied), iff that Attestation's DSSE
envelope verifies**; an unsigned attestation proves nothing to a
verifying consumer, and a validator without keys reports the digest
match as UNVERIFIED rather than granting proof; (3) otherwise
**consumer**.
Duties bind at consumer tier only; conformant tools report claimed and
proven distinctly, because a prefix is an honest-publisher signal while
a signature is evidence — the same layering as the two digest domains.
Derivation vectors: `tier-vectors.json` (9 cases, incl. proof rescuing
a cross-origin id, an authority attestation over the wrong subject
proving nothing, and the wrapper-Set laundering case).

**Deterministic resolution (normative algorithm, Appendix B):** operations
are an **ordered list**, applied sequentially after selection; **two
operations addressing the same target within one Tailoring = validation
error** (overrides happen auditable via Tailoring-of-Tailoring chaining,
never silently); independent Tailorings over one catalog are separate
artifacts — there is **no auto-merge**, by design and by history (1.x
merge semantics are the corpse in the basement). Hop budget harmonized with
D14 (P8-E3): one shared predicate vocabulary, one budget — at most one
reference hop, everywhere.

## D14 — Rules: eight primitives, one bounded conditional, **no general-purpose expression language.** *(rev. v0.5 — wording P8; tier P8-E1)*
Unchanged in substance. `attestation-binds` evaluation moves to **Portable**
(Core treats Attestation objects as schema-valid data) — resolving P8-E1's
Core/JCS contradiction. The ledger phrase is corrected to the defensible
form: primitives + ops + predicates are a small closed DSL; what the design
excludes is a *general-purpose* expression language — the distinction that
matters for complexity re-inflation.

## D15 — Conformance: **Core is the passive tier**; normative feature × tier matrix. *(rev. v0.5 — P7-B3 + P8-E1)*
**Decision.** Core is redefined as **passive**: validate kernel structure,
verify package digests, resolve references locally, **preserve everything
unknown** — and perform **no semantic computation whatsoever**. All
computations of the four classes (tailoring resolution, assessment,
selection, normative rendering) plus JCS/semantic digests and
`attestation-binds` begin at **Portable**. A Core processor encountering
facets preserves them and refuses semantic computation over affected
objects — the silent-ignore state P7-B3 exposed is unrepresentable.

RFC-0024's approved-format slot maps to **Portable**.

## D16 — Migration: three guarantee levels; "information-preserving for the supported corpus."
Unchanged (native / compatibility-facet / opaque-preservation; kernel→1.x
export exists for the transition with kernel-native concepts flattening to
props/links — syntactically valid, semantically reduced; round-trip corpus
with published equivalence). New note: the 1.2.2 Mapping Model becomes a
native-mapping source/target for D20 objects.

## D17 — Declared non-goals.
Unchanged (flows as linked resources; template accreditation open (R6);
narrative grammar optional; executable proof deferred to the gate) — plus:
**PCI's customized approach and ISO's management-system clauses are named
extension targets, not covered claims** (P7/P8 coverage verdicts adopted
verbatim into the coverage table).

## D18 — XML transit projection, strictly fenced.
Unchanged: kernel+stdlib authored in a transit-safe schema subset with
guaranteed strict XSD; third-party facets opaque unless publisher-mapped;
one-way, never authoring; consequence documented (R11).

## D19 — Positioning.
Unchanged: engine that compiles to 1.x during transition; sunset trigger;
name avoids "2.0"/"profile"/"kernel" — leading candidate **OSCAL Semantic
Core**; on-ramps stated accurately (#58 and #2050 live; #2115/#2116 closed
design positions); RFC-0024's five-CSP clause recorded without endorsement.

## D20 — **`Mapping` as the ninth kernel type.** *(new, v0.5 — P7 mapping analysis accepted over P8's facet alternative)* *(rev. v0.6 cycle — R1 #5)*
**Decision.** A shallow first-class object:

```json
{ "id": "https://scf.example/map/nist-ac2--iso-a5.16",
  "version": "2026.2",
  "lifecycle": "active",
  "source-ref": "https://ns.nist.gov/sp800-53/req/AC-2",
  "source-scope": ["statement:a"],
  "target-ref": "https://ns.iso.example/27002/req/5.16",
  "relationship": "subset-of",        // stdlib code system: IR 8477 / OLIR
                                       // equal | subset-of | superset-of |
                                       // intersects | supports | conflicts
                                       // + supplements (Semantic Core
                                       //   extension code, v0.6 cycle)
  "direction": "source-to-target",
  "confidence": "reviewed",
  "rationale": "…",
  "provenance": { "author-ref": "…", "date": "…" },
  "evidence-refs": ["…"] }
```

Many-to-many is many objects; statement-level scoping via `source-scope`/
`target-scope`; version pinning via normal L0 references; contradictory
mappings from different authorities coexist as distinct objects with
distinct provenance — consumers choose by authority, exactly as they do
with catalogs.

**`supplements` (rev. v0.6 cycle — R1 #5).** One relationship code added
beyond the adopted IR 8477 set, clearly marked as a Semantic Core stdlib
extension: *source attaches additional normative content to target* — the
clause-precision attachment of the supplement pattern (D21), e.g.
`target-scope: ["statement:s2"]` on the upstream anchor. It is not a
crosswalk claim: `supplements` does **not** chain in the Chapter 8
composition arithmetic (degrade as `supports`), and OLIR-facing exports
MAY down-translate it to `supports` losslessly for that reason.

**Evidence.** SCF's raison d'être is mapping 1,500+ controls to 200+
frameworks; CIS and CSA ship mapping documents as core products; NIST
publishes OLIR; CR26 itself carries 263 KSI→800-53 mappings; and NIST just
shipped an **entire eighth document model** for mappings (March 2026) —
proof of demand, and proof of the 1.x pattern (a deep document tree with
uuid/metadata/revisions and props throughout) this kernel exists to
replace.

**Rationale (north star applied).** *Customer:* the mapping graph **is** the
product for SCF/CSA/CIS and the multi-framework reality of every regulated
enterprise. *Simplicity:* one nine-field shallow object replaces a full
document model. *No props / no bespoke:* without a first-class home,
mappings regress into `relations`-type strings (props by another name) and
SCF stays on bespoke Excel/JSON — the two exact failure modes the north
star forbids. **Rejected:** P8's stdlib-facet variant — facets attach *to*
objects, but a third-party crosswalk (SCF mapping NIST↔ISO) belongs to
neither endpoint and needs its own identity, lifecycle, and provenance;
the type-count argument (retired in D4).

## D21 — **Hierarchy and ordering, normatively.** *(new, v0.5 — P8 hierarchy gap)* *(rev. v0.6 cycle — R1 #5)*
**Decision.** RequirementSets nest: `members[]` entries are
`{ref (requirement **or set**), sequence}`; `sequence` is a defined kernel
field (ascending integer, unique within one members list, presentation
order — no normative semantics beyond order). Taxonomies are nested sets:
CSF Functions → Categories → Subcategories, SCF's 34 domains, ISO 27002
themes, CIS Controls → Safeguards — all sets-of-sets with sequence; ISM's
`sort-id` ×1,150 absorption is thereby *specified*, not just asserted.
**Rejected.** Reintroducing group/part nesting on Requirements (the #2118
attractor); order-as-annotation (props by another name).

**Named pattern (rev. v0.6 cycle — R1 #5): the supplement pattern.**
Amending a catalog you do not own is composition, never injection: the
supplement author publishes new Requirements under their **own** prefix and
composes them with the upstream via a **shadow set** — a Set under the
supplement author's identity whose `members[]` interleave upstream refs and
additions by `sequence`, with multi-authority membership safe under D2
global identity. Clause-level attachment binds by reference (a `relations`
edge or a statement-scoped Mapping speaking `supplements`, D20), because
foreign statements live inside the owner's object and semantic digest. What
profile resolution used to *produce*, the shadow Set *is*; the interleaved
reading view is an L4 rendering per D4. The corpse is measured: eleven
shared ids across two publications of one authority, ten silently diverged
— forking-to-amend at inter-organizational scale. (Handbook §6.A; Appendix
F Q23.)

## D22 — **Kernel promotion rule.** *(new, v0.6 cycle — review round 1, backlog #4)*
**Decision.** A semantic is promoted from facet space into the kernel
**only** when all three tests hold:

1. **≥ 2 of 3 independent authority encodings** in the census corpus
   (convergence, not committee preference);
2. **one shared computation** every generic tool must perform on it
   (modality: monotonicity checking);
3. **one vocabulary fits all corpora without flattening** (modality: one
   lattice; counter-example: security-objective values "1"/"0" share no
   scale with anyone).

A candidate that passes test 1 but whose kernel *mechanism* already exists
is absorbed by that mechanism, not by a new field — assurance levels are
the instructive case: genuinely 3-of-3, yet level-as-a-field is the
5,301-marker corpse; level-as-a-Set composes, while the incommensurable
vocabularies stay in `assurance-levels@1`. Future "why isn't X kernel"
disputes cite this rule; a promotion PR that cannot show its three passes
is rejected without further argument — the anti-#2118 discipline applied
to the kernel itself.

**The anticipated-convergence path (second clause, same cycle).** The
census population is three; a consensus of the *current* customers is a
floor, not a ceiling. Promotion is therefore also permitted when (1) a
major authority in the census ships the semantic and depends on it, (2)
general use by other frameworks is credibly anticipated, with the
anticipation argued in the register, and (3) the absorption clause above
still holds. The discipline that keeps this honest: such a promotion
carries evidence tier **anticipated** — below measured, explicitly
labeled — and is re-verified against every corpus addition; an
anticipation that fails to materialize after two gate cycles demotes the
semantic back to a facet, the backlog standing rule applied to the kernel.
The motivating example: a glossary is 1-of-3 today (CR26's FRD — 75
terms, 188 aliases, 264 references resolving), yet every national
framework publishes terminology; the computation (alias-aware term
resolution) is already measured. The re-audit of the facet space under
this clause is recorded in the register amendment.
**Customer.** Every authority pays for every kernel field forever (a tax on
each Core validator); the census is the only party that may levy it.
**Simplicity.** The bar is three questions with countable answers.
**Complexity ↓.** Ends promotion-by-advocacy — the historical re-inflation
channel by which cores grow until they require a metaschema.
**Trade-off.** A genuinely novel semantic with only one national encoding
waits in a facet until a second authority ships it — deliberate: the
kernel lags evidence, never leads taste. First stated publicly in Appendix
F Q22; normative here.

# Part III — Worked examples

III.1 (BSI KONF.14.1), III.2 (CR26 IEC rule + class Tailoring), III.3
(ISM, zero facets) carry over from v0.4 unchanged in substance, with two
corrections: III.2's effectivity dates differentiated
(`optional-adoption: 2025-11-01`, `must-obtain-by: 2026-07-04`,
`grace-until: 2027-01-01` — illustrative), and the class Tailoring now
demonstrates the parameter-bounds rule (setting `iir-deadline` to a value
outside a declared range would fail without a Deviation). New:

## III.4 — A cross-framework mapping (SCF-shaped)

```json
{ "id": "https://ns.scf.example/map/2026-2/ac-2--iso-5.16",
  "version": "2026.2", "lifecycle": "active",
  "source-ref": "https://ns.nist.gov/sp800-53/req/AC-2",
  "target-ref": "https://ns.iso.example/27002/req/5.16",
  "relationship": "intersects", "direction": "source-to-target",
  "confidence": "reviewed",
  "provenance": {"author-ref": "https://ns.scf.example/party/scf", "date": "2026-05-01"} }
```

Props: 0. Bespoke spreadsheet columns: 0. The SCF corpus becomes a package
of such objects plus its framework facet.

# Part IV — Ledger, risks, gate, changelog

## IV.1 Complexity ledger

**Removed vs. OSCAL 1.2.2:** eight deep document models (incl. the
March-2026 Mapping Model) · Metaschema · profile-resolution algebra + merge
strategies · XML/YAML conformance + serialization mapping · Schematron ·
anonymous inline constraints · comp-def/SSP duplication · general JSON
Patch. **Kernel:** 9 shallow types · 2 sub-objects · 1 serialization · JSON
Schema 2020-12 · 8 primitives + a closed op vocabulary + 3 predicates ·
**no general-purpose expression language** · 0 document conventions. The
six retained subsystems (kernel schemas; content-manifest protocol; facet
system; rule interpreter; tailoring resolver; attestation protocol) are
each narrower and more boring than what they replace — a claim scheduled
for **measurement at the v0.6 gate**, not asserted.

## IV.2 Risk register (delta)

R1–R12 carry over with status updates (R4 softened by pinning+composition
rule). New: **R13** — IR 8477/OLIR relationship code-system governance
(stdlib ownership); **R14** — calendar-context dependency: calendar-periods
are honest but push a real-world dependency (holiday calendars) into
Authority publication duties; **R15** — CIS corpus status unverified
(scope-statement item).

## IV.3 Prior art (delta)
Add: **NIST OSCAL 1.2.2 Control Mapping Model** — as demand evidence *and*
as the negative pattern (deep document model, props throughout) D20
replaces; NIST IR 8477 / OLIR (relationship semantics).

## IV.4 Coverage table (P7/P8 verdicts adopted)

| User | Verdict | Basis |
|---|---|---|
| BSI, ASD, FedRAMP CR26 | Designed-for, **measured corpora**, proof at gate | census |
| NIST 800-53 / 800-171 | Designed-for (D11 + sets/tailoring) | catalog layer |
| NIST CSF 2.0 | Designed-for after **D21** (hierarchy) + prose-only statements | |
| NIST full lifecycle (SSP/AP/AR/POA&M/Mapping round-trip) | **Not yet demonstrated** — gate corpus item | |
| CIS | Catalog + IGs via sets; mappings via D20; corpus status R15 | |
| SCF | Catalog + **D20 mappings** (its central use case now first-class) | |
| CSA CCM | Controls + CAIQ→assessment-criteria plausible; mappings via D20; full STAR package not claimed | |
| ISO 27001/27002 | Structurally adaptable (attributes → framework facet; sealed manifests help licensed distribution); **management-system clauses not covered** — named target | |
| PCI DSS | Testing procedures → assessment-criteria; compensating controls → Deviation; **customized approach encoding undefined** — named target | |

## IV.5 The v0.6 gate (executable; renamed from v0.5 — reasons on title page)

1. Full-corpus converters + computed coverage for ISM, BSI, CR26 — zero
   unexplained fields.
2. Executable kernel + stdlib JSON Schemas; conformance corpus incl. JCS
   vectors (with empty-omission cases), modality-lattice cases,
   parameter-bounds cases, tailoring-conflict cases, bi-modal attestation
   cases. **DELIVERED 2026-07-21:** `semantic-oscal/schemas/` (kernel
   schema, closed shapes, shape-disjoint type inference + six normative
   stdlib descriptors with the D10-rev-2 declarations) ·
   `semantic-oscal/conformance/` (54 vectors across five families at first
   delivery; **129 across nine families at HEAD** after the P9 + v0.6-round-2
   + gate-3 additions — recompute via `validate_core.py`, backlog #28) ·
   `semantic-oscal/scripts/validate_core.py` (the executable). Measured
   result: all vectors pass; all 8 corpus bundles + the example bundle
   validate green — 5,478 object validations, both digests re-verified
   per object, by-statement keys and `{param:}` bindings checked, every
   object matching exactly one kernel shape; all nine types exercised.
   P9 scope correction: 5,478 = 5,470 manifest-listed objects + 8
   manifest checks; the example bundle's 13 objects (the only instances
   of the five lifecycle types) are shape-checked without digest
   verification. Appendix-B items parked "at gate item 2" that this
   delivery did not include (B.1.3 negative corpus, B.1.8 conditional
   instantiation, B.1.7 DSSE profile) are re-parked in backlog #18 —
   they did not silently close.
3. **Lifecycle corpus** beyond catalogs: NIST SSP/AP/AR/POA&M + 1.2.2
   Mapping examples; FedRAMP implementation/assessment data; CSA CAIQ;
   SCF mappings; representative PCI customized-approach cases. In scope
   here (folded from the backlog, v0.6 cycle): confirm or extend the
   seed code sets for finding states and assessment results from counted
   lifecycle evidence (was backlog #9), and resolve CTL/ODP
   statement-level addressing via the NIST catalog conversion (backlog
   #10).
4. Measured complexity comparison vs. an OSCAL 1.2.2 validator + resolver
   (two languages, LoC, contributor-hours) — the weekend-validator
   acceptance test. In scope here (folded from review round 2,
   2026-07-21): the **bidirectional export test suite** — Semantic Core
   objects compile to syntactically valid OSCAL 1.2.2 JSON for the
   supported corpus and the round-trip is verified mechanically;
   down-conversion moves from *designed-for* to *measured*.

## IV.6 Changelog v0.4 → v0.5

| Finding | Verdict | Change |
|---|---|---|
| P7-B1 (manifest↔attestation hash cycle) + P6-F1 (strip breaks signature) | **Accept (merged)** | D3 content-manifest excludes attestations; D7 bi-modal verification (Full/Semantic) |
| P6-F2 (tailoring parameter evasion) + P7-B2 (weakening invariant incomplete) | **Accept, bounded** | D13 per-operation rules incl. parameter-bounds, tightening direction, detach/prose rules; invariant honestly narrowed. **Rejected in part:** "exclude ⇒ Deviation" (selection ≠ weakening; would drown baselines) |
| P6-F3 (JCS empty/omitted ambiguity) | **Accept** | D3 pre-JCS omission rule + vectors |
| P6-F4 (`private:` fail-closed paradox) + P7-G4 (publisher-honesty default) | **Accept (merged)** | D10: `private:` ≡ modifies-semantics [] (preserve+ignore); undeclared registered ≡ all four classes (fail-closed) |
| P7-B3 (Core silently ignores facets) + P8-E1 (Core/attestation-binds/JCS) | **Accept (merged)** | D15 Core = passive tier; semantic computation forbidden at Core; attestation-binds → Portable |
| P7-B4 (supersedes ≠ equivalence) | **Accept** | D2 canonical-alias vs. replaces{relationship} |
| P8-E2 (modality order undefined) | **Accept** | D9 normative partial order incl. may-only/DARF NUR |
| P8-E3 (hop budget mismatch) | **Accept** | one predicate vocabulary, one ≤1-hop budget |
| P8-E4 + P7-G5 (bundle composition of pins) | **Accept** | D3 semver-normative composition rule |
| P7 mapping gap (ninth type) vs. P8 (stdlib facet) | **Accept P7, reject P8 variant** | **D20 Mapping kernel type**; type-count dogma retired (D4) |
| P8 hierarchy gap | **Accept** | **D21** nested sets + normative `sequence` |
| P7-G (authorization scoping) | **Accept** | D5 identified authorizations + includes[] |
| P7-G (bizdays/calendar, decimal) | **Accept** | D9 elapsed vs. calendar-period (fail-closed computation); D3 decimal-as-string |
| P7-U (undefined elements; resolution order) | **Accept** | Appendices A/B; D13 ordered ops, same-target = error, chaining for overrides, no auto-merge |
| P7/P8 adopter-list & baseline corrections | **Accept; conflict resolved by search** | Part I §2 scope statement; baseline = **1.2.2** (P8's "no 1.2.x" was a cutoff artifact — verified against NIST pages); CIS status → R15 |
| P8 minor (ledger wording; III.2 dates) | **Accept** | "no general-purpose expression language"; dates differentiated |
| Pass 5 (Grok) | Validating; no blockers | v0.6 gate emphasis adopted |

## IV.7 v0.6-cycle decisions (2026-07-21; from the review-round-1 backlog)

Backlog items decided per the standing rule (counts in, register entries
out); rows leave `oscal-semantic-core-v0.6-spec-feedback-backlog.md`:

| Backlog | Decision | Change |
|---|---|---|
| #4 | **Accept** | **D22** kernel promotion rule normative (≥2-of-3 encodings · one shared computation · one vocabulary without flattening; existing-mechanism absorption clause) — was implicit, first stated in App. F Q22 |
| #5 | **Accept** | Supplement pattern named normatively in D21; `supplements` registered as stdlib relationship extension code in D20 (non-chaining; OLIR down-translation to `supports`) |
| #7 | **Accept** | D10: `by-statement` payload keying normative; unknown statement id = validation error |
| #1 | **Accept** | D9: optional `label` + `default` on parameter declarations; defaults advisory, never silently substituted; empties the ×179 `param-extras` L2 residue (drains at next converter run) |
| #2 | **Accept (Tailoring liturgy blessed for authorities)** | D13: Deviation duties bind at consumption tier; Authority-tier Tailorings exempt (weakening classification still computed). **Rejected:** `variants` carrier on Requirement — fails the D22 bar (1-of-3; mechanism exists) |
| #3 | **Close, no change** | Duration union rejected for lack of evidence: 0 true unit-class crossings measured (the 51 first-pass flags were base-absent variants, resolved under #2); elapsed/calendar unit-class boundary stays strict. Re-enters only with a counted crossing |
| — | **D22 rev (user directive)** | Anticipated-convergence path added: 1-of-3 promotion permitted for a major customer's semantic with credibly anticipated general use; evidence tier `anticipated`, re-verified per corpus, demotes after two dry gate cycles. Facet-space re-audit recorded in the register (terminology = strongest candidate; reporting-obligation = candidate pending an EU corpus) |
| #6 | **Re-scoped** | Terminology: kernel home now permitted under the D22 anticipated path; final shape (carrier object vs. root-Set hosting) decides with the gate-2 schemas |
| #8 | **Accept (promote all three)** | D10 rev 2: `security-objectives@1` → `[selection]`, `effectivity@1` → `[selection]`, `reporting-obligation@1` → `[assessment]`; principle: a tool that cannot handle a facet must stop working on that data. Stubs update at next converter run |
| #9 | **Close, folded into gate 3** | Seed code sets stay as shipped; confirmation/extension from counted lifecycle evidence is now part of the gate-3 scope statement (IV.5) — no standing backlog row needed |
| #11 | **Close, delivered** | Source-QA finding (9 MUSS-in-prose clauses without `modal_verb`, grammar coverage 99.1 %) reported to the BSI authors by the project; companion to the 216/issue #58; never was a spec change |
| #6 | **Close (gate 2): root-Set hosting normative** | D22-applied: the absorption clause decides — `terminology@1` hosts on a Set (typically corpus root), whose identity/lifecycle govern the glossary; carrier object / tenth type rejected (264/264 resolution measured with zero new structure). Normative in the stdlib descriptor |

## IV.8 v0.6-cycle round 2 (2026-07-22) — P9c adjudication + deep-research items

Acting on the P9c re-review (the P9-cycle enforcement shipped narrower
than the register's prose) and the deep-research open items. Full
entries in the register ("Amendments — v0.6 cycle, round 2"); normative
in D3/D9/D13, the schema, and Appendices A–C. Backlog #13/#14/#15/#21/
#22/#23/#25/#27/#28 **closed**; #20/#24/#26 **narrowed** (residuals on
the converter rerun / gate-4 engines); **#12 decided** (D9 rev 2 — the
`text` primitive; EU-27-languages rationale; delivery rides the rerun);
#10/#18 open. Summary:
**#25** op-law completed (`set-parameter` bounds/tightening +
`remove-relation(required)` now enforced — the P6-F2 backdoor was
shipped unenforced); **#24** tier reported distinctly (spec:399), proven
tier's signature check deferred to gate 4; **#14** canonical-alias
self-policing; **#27** decimal no-leading-zeros + scale significant;
**#21** `sequence` struck from the set-field whitelist; **#20** D13
relation row aligned + C.8 `supersedes` deleted; **#13**
`calendar-context@1` seeded; **#22** anticipated path scoped pre-1.0;
**#23** nearest-Set = fewest hops; **#15** template accreditation a
declared non-goal. Conformance **115 → 125 vectors**. Gate 3 plan:
`drafts/gate-3-plan.md`.

## IV.9 Gate 3 DELIVERED (2026-07-22) — NIST/CSF/lifecycle corpus

Census-first per ch14.4 (`drafts/gate-3-census.md`); register entries
under "Amendments — gate 3". Three new bundles, one drained backlog
item, two reference-validator defects found and fixed by the corpus:

- **US.SP800-53** (`convert_nist.py`): Rev 5.2.0 catalog + four 800-53B
  baselines → 1,014 Requirements + 25 Sets, 115,680 leaves, UNMAPPED 0.
  **Zero kernel-schema changes forced — the customer test passed.** All
  373 pre-existing corpus mapping endpoints resolve against the minted
  ids. 182 withdrawn tombstones dropped with lineage inverted onto the
  successors' kernel `replaces[]` (incl. one family-Set successor:
  sa-12 → SR). The SP 800-53A layer rides `sp800-53a@1` (3,715
  objectives — the CTL addressing surface); two-layer ODP params are
  statement-scoped per the 216 rule.
- **US.CSF** (`convert_csf.py`): CSF 2.0 → 106 Requirements + 29 Sets
  (D21 3-level nesting), 4,726 leaves, UNMAPPED 0. Sixth declarative
  corpus (modality `unspecified` ×106). Withdrawn measured 91 = 12
  categories + 79 subcategories; 134 successor edges.
- **US.IFA-GoodRead** (`convert_ifa.py`): the five lifecycle types at
  document scale with both digests verified — SSP → Component (+ the
  ATO as `authorizations[]` + an Attestation over semantic digests),
  AP+AR → Assessment (result not-satisfied), POA&M risks → Findings
  (in-remediation; one approved `risk-adjustment` Deviation), and the
  leveraged/leveraging pair → `inherited-from{component, basis-ref}`
  with the D5 edge-local closure enforced. Carried Requirements
  (AC-6.1, AC-2) ride in-bundle — an authorization package carries its
  baseline. **#9 seeds confirmed: every source state mapped into the
  shipped enums, zero code additions.**
- **#10 DRAINED** (`convert_cr26.py` rev): the CTL overlay's 16 ODP
  assignments → `set-parameter` operations on a `rev5-odp-overlay`
  Tailoring, each addressed via the DECLARING statement (measured: no
  Rev 5 ODP is declared in two statements — the (requirement, ODP) pair
  is a sufficient address). 14 tailored controls carried in-bundle.
  Guidance entries stay parked (D20 supplements territory).
- **Validator defects the corpus exposed (both fixed + vectored):**
  (a) tier derivation stopped at the wrapper Set's id — a self-minted
  Set around foreign content laundered consumer into authority-claimed
  (D13 rev 4, above); (b) `param_check` ignored `cardinality: many` —
  list values on multi-select choices had no legal form (D9: a list
  value is legal exactly on `many`, every element declared).
- Source findings (all REPORTED upstream): CSF underscore rel codes vs
  Rev 5 hyphens; a fragment-marker-less href (DE.DP-04); 3
  cross-control param insertions; 71 ODPs bound nowhere; `_stmt.` vs
  `_smt.` statement-id spellings; FedRAMP multi-select values
  flattened to prose strings (normalized to lists ×3); PUA codepoints
  in IFA prose; placeholder uuids in the leveraged pair.

Conformance **125 → 129 vectors**. Corpus at HEAD: **11 bundles, 6,675
manifest-listed objects** (recompute via `validate_core.py`).

## IV.10 Gate 4 DELIVERED (2026-07-22) — engines + the two economic claims measured

Same-day with gate 3 (plan `drafts/gate-4-plan.md`; measurement
`drafts/gate-4-measurement.md`; register "Amendments — gate 4").
Backlog **#18 and #24 closed**; conformance **129 → 149 vectors** in 12
families (+ dsse 5 · composition 7 · conditional 8).

- **DSSE verification engine (#24, D7-applied).** Ed25519 (RFC 8032)
  dependency-free in both implementations; envelope payload = the
  Attestation's canonical form, signature input = PAE per DSSE v1;
  trusted keys are INPUT, never bundle content. Verification mode makes
  `authority-proven` require a verifying envelope — the unsigned-
  attestation forgery (P9c-1) is closed; structural mode reports
  `UNVERIFIED` distinctly.
- **Composition engine (D3.5-applied).** `--compose A B`: highest
  pinned minor wins with BOTH payload sets re-validated; major clashes,
  divergent twins, and cross-version collisions are reported errors,
  never silent picks.
- **`conditional-apply` engine (B.1.8-applied).** One B.2 predicate
  trigger (the one-hop budget and the no-nesting rule enforced
  structurally), one instantiated primitive, the normative FAIL format
  vector-locked; unbound trigger params error instead of silently-false.
- **Bidirectional export suite (IV.5.4).** 10/10 catalog bundles →
  OSCAL 1.2.2 validated against the OFFICIAL NIST release schema;
  generic re-import; round-trip **5,647/5,647 objects semantic-digest-
  equal (100 %)**. Down-conversion is now *measured*. D16 asymmetries
  measured on the way: groups cannot mix subgroups+controls; params
  require label|select; NIST's own JSON schema needs `\p{}` regexes
  beyond Python's stdlib.
- **The weekend validator (IV.5.4).** `validate_core.ps1` — PowerShell
  5.1, zero installs, the stock auditor's Windows box: **149/149
  vectors** with full parity to the Python reference. Sizes (one
  counter, non-blank non-comment): Python reference **938** lines +
  jsonschema; PowerShell **1,110** lines + *nothing*; vs
  **30,905 lines / 162 files** for compliance-trestle 4.2.0 (the OSCAL
  1.x validator+resolver toolchain, tests excluded) — ~30× with the
  crypto engines included. Authorship recorded honestly in R8: same
  author + AI, independence limited to language/runtime; the
  clean-room third-party build is the standing invitation.

## IV.11 The converter rerun (2026-07-22) — the backlog reaches zero

The first step of the 1.0 release train (register "Amendments — the
converter rerun"): the three decided-but-undelivered items land in one
digest churn across all 11 bundles.

- **#12 DELIVERED — the `text` primitive.** `langMap` → `text`;
  `title`, `rationale` (Deviation/Mapping/excludes), `description`
  (capabilities/actions) are `{BCP-47: string | [string]}` everywhere —
  schema, bundles (GS++ and C3A carry `de`, the rest `en`), fixtures,
  the 13 examples, the reader (v1.6.1), and the OSCAL export
  (round-trip stays 5,647/5,647). Identifiers and labels stay strings.
- **#20 DELIVERED — URI-shaped extension relations.** Relation `type` =
  the five base codes ∪ `^https?://`; C5's `sharpens` ×28 →
  `https://ns.bsi.bund.de/c5/rel/sharpens`. Measured on the way:
  OSCAL 1.2.2 link `rel` is a token — URI relation vocabularies cannot
  ride 1.x links at all (props channel, counted ×28).
- **#26 DELIVERED — normative fail-closed pins.** Every pin closes its
  shape; stdlib ids are pinned VERBATIM and both validators reject a
  diverging stdlib pin. The strict pins immediately surfaced every
  undeclared payload key (30 keys across 5 facets) — each now a
  declared contract.

**The v0.6 spec-feedback backlog is EMPTY** — every item that entered
it left via a register entry. Remaining before the 1.0 tag: spec
consolidation into a release document (+ the D22 pre-1.0 marker and
the name decision), `v1.0.0-rc.1`, one adversarial review round (P10)
of the consolidated text.

# Appendix A — Normative kernel shapes (summary; JSON Schemas at the v0.6 gate)

Common to all nine types: `id (URI) · version · label? · aliases[]? ·
lifecycle (draft | active | deprecated | withdrawn) · canonical-alias[]? ·
replaces[]? · facets{}? · annotations{}? · relations[]? {type (open token;
normative cross-framework claims use Mapping), ref}`.

- **Requirement:** `title · statements[] (D9) · deviations[]?` —
  statements: `{id · modality · obligated-parties[] · parameters[] ·
  prose{lang}}`.
- **RequirementSet:** `title? · members[] {ref (requirement|set) ·
  sequence}` (D21).
- **Tailoring:** `selects[] {set-ref | predicate} · excludes[] {ref} ·
  operations[] (ordered; D13 vocabulary)`.
- **Component:** `kind · members[] {component-ref · context (free token)} ·
  capabilities[] {id · requirement-ref? · description · parameter-
  bindings?} · authorizations[] (D5)`.
- **Implementation:** D6 field list.
- **Assessment:** `subject-refs[] · method (facet-typed) · performer-ref ·
  time · result (code) · evidence-refs[] · deviations[]?`.
- **Finding:** `assessment-ref · requirement-ref · statement-ref? · state
  (code) · risk (facet) · actions[] {description · due
  (date|calendar-period) · status} · deviations[]?`.
- **Attestation:** D7 field list (outside content manifests by
  definition).
- **Mapping:** D20 field list.
- **Deviation (sub-object):** D8 field list.
- **Content manifest:** `manifest-version · objects[] {id · version ·
  package-digest · semantic-digest · path} · facet-schemas[] {id ·
  exact-version · digest · path} · renderings[]?` — attestations/envelopes
  excluded (D3).

Code systems (stdlib): modality (with the D9 order), lifecycle, deviation
types/states, responsibility, assessment results, mapping relationships
(IR 8477/OLIR), duration units (elapsed/calendar), confidence.

# Appendix B — Tailoring resolution (normative algorithm)

1. Resolve `selects` (set-refs expanded via D21 nesting; predicates
   evaluated with the shared ≤1-hop vocabulary) → candidate set;
   apply `excludes`.
2. Validate `operations[]`: addressing resolves (else fail closed);
   no two operations share a target within this Tailoring (else error).
3. Apply operations **in list order** to deep-copied objects; enforce D13
   rules (parameter bounds, tightening, modality order, detach/prose) —
   violations without an attached Deviation fail closed with rationale.
4. Emit a resolved package with a fresh content manifest; provenance
   records the Tailoring id+version. Tailoring-of-Tailoring = run again on
   the emitted package (chaining is the only override path). Independent
   Tailorings never auto-merge.
