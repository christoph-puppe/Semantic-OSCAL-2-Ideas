# OSCAL Semantic Core — v0.6 Spec-Feedback Backlog
### Consolidated open design questions from gate item 1 and the first review round · 2026-07-19

Every item carries its evidence (measured where possible), its
proposed disposition, and its source. This file is the input queue
for the v0.6 specification revision; items leave it only via a
decision recorded in the register.

**THE BACKLOG IS EMPTY** (2026-07-22, the converter rerun — register
"Amendments — the converter rerun"): **#12 DELIVERED** (the `text`
primitive live in schema, all 11 bundles, fixtures, examples, reader
v1.6.1, and the OSCAL export — D9 rev 2) · **#20 DELIVERED** (relation
extension types URI-constrained in the schema; `sharpens` ×28 migrated
to `https://ns.bsi.bund.de/c5/rel/sharpens`) · **#26 DELIVERED** (all
pins fail-closed `additionalProperties: false`; stdlib pins VERBATIM
with divergence enforced by both validators). Every item that ever
entered this file has left it through a register entry.

| # | Item | Evidence | Proposed disposition | Source |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 12 | **`text` primitive — DECIDED, adopt** *(author 2026-07-22; register "D9 rev 2").* `text` = `{BCP-47: string}` for all human-readable fields (`title` ×3,041, Mapping `rationale` ×373, action/capability descriptions, deviation rationale, facet free text); identifiers stay strings (`id`/`version`/codes/`label`). Generalizes the existing `langMap`. Payload harmonization **shipped for ISM + CR26** (2026-07-21). | **Rationale: EU standards must be available in all 27 official languages** (NIS2/DORA/CRA); the tagged-vs-bare inconsistency is already measured (converters disagreed) | Delivery — schema field-switch + all-converter reruns + full re-pin — **rides the converter rerun** (a transitional string-or-`text` schema MAY bridge); stays open until delivered | Review round 1, finding 3 |
| 20 | **Relations: constrain extension types to URI shape** *(round-2 partial).* Done: D13 row aligned with B.3 (`remove-relation(required) ⇒ Deviation`); C.8 `supersedes` deleted (register "C.8 rev"). Remaining: the schema types relation `type` as any non-empty string, so a typo'd base code silently becomes a carried extension (P9b-4). **Blocked on the converter rerun** migrating the corpus's bare-word `sharpens` ×28 to a namespaced URI. | P9b-4; `sharpens` ×28 measured | After the rerun: constrain extension relation `type` to a URI shape (base codes ∪ URI) in the schema; add a vector | P9 run 2 |
| 26 | **Facet enforcement: ship real pinned schemas + pin-honoring** *(round-2 partial).* Decision recorded (register "D26"): stdlib strict, non-stdlib against the pin. Remaining: bundles pin permissive illustrative stubs (`additionalProperties` defaults `true`), so framework/compat payloads are under-validated and the reference validator diverges from a pin-honoring sealed tool. | Demonstrated: `cr26/scope` stub accepts a smuggled key; stubs are ILLUSTRATIVE | **Converter rerun** ships pinned schemas with `additionalProperties:false`; fix pin-vs-descriptor precedence | P9c run (2026-07-22), Major P9c-3 |

**Closed 2026-07-21** (review round 1 decisions; register "Amendments —
v0.6 cycle" + spec changelog IV.7): **#1** → D9 rev (parameter
`label`/`default`; residue drains at next converter run) · **#2** → D13
rev (Deviation duties bind at consumption tier; authority Tailorings
exempt; `variants` carrier rejected via the D22 bar) · **#4** → **D22**
(kernel promotion rule normative) · **#5** → D20/D21 rev (supplement
pattern named; `supplements` stdlib relationship extension code) ·
**#7** → D10 rev (`by-statement` keying normative) · **#3** → closed
no-change (D9 closure note: 0 true unit-class crossings measured — the
51 first-pass flags were base-absent variants, resolved under #2's D13
rev; the elapsed/calendar unit-class boundary stays strict) · **#8** →
D10 rev 2 (declarations promoted: security-objectives/effectivity →
`[selection]`, reporting-obligation → `[assessment]`; a tool that cannot
handle a facet must stop working on that data; stubs update at next
converter run) · **#9** → closed, folded into the gate-3 scope statement
(IV.5): seed sets confirm/extend only from counted lifecycle evidence ·
**#11** → closed, delivered: reported to the BSI authors by the project
(companion to the 216/issue #58; never a spec change) · **#6** → closed
at gate 2 (2026-07-21): root-Set hosting normative in the terminology
stdlib descriptor; carrier/tenth-type rejected via the D22 absorption
clause (register "D22-applied") · **#16** → closed (2026-07-21,
register "P9-applied"): reference taxonomy normative — closure-required
(Set members, Tailoring selects/excludes/op targets + statement
existence, Implementation component/requirement + D5 basis-ref, Finding
refs, Mapping scopes when the endpoint is in-bundle) vs. landmark
(Mapping endpoints, party URIs, evidence, attestation subjects);
implemented + 9 vectors; parties stay landmark by the D22 test (0-of-3
corpora publish party objects) · **#17** → closed (2026-07-21,
register "P9-applied"): facet payloads validate against normative
stdlib descriptors or bundle-pinned schemas, `private:` ignored by
definition, unregistered ⇒ error; 7 vectors incl. the P9-1 probe; all
8 bundles green under enforcement · **#19** → closed (2026-07-21,
register "P9-applied", layered per user decision): tier DERIVED from
data — id-origin match = authority-claimed, authority Attestation over
the Tailoring (digest-verified) = authority-proven (proof beats
prefix), else consumer; duties bind at consumer tier; 8 derivation
vectors; op-duty enforcement live in bundle validation (CR26's four
class Tailorings derive authority-claimed). Numbering stays stable —
closed numbers are not reused.

**Closed 2026-07-22** (v0.6 cycle round 2; register "Amendments — v0.6
cycle, round 2" — acts on the P9c re-review + the deep-research open
items): **#13** → `calendar-context@1` stdlib code system seeded (C.9:
us-federal/de-bund/eu-target2; `calendar-ref` SHOULD cite it) · **#14**
→ canonical-alias same-content check implemented in `closure_errors` +
2 reference vectors (register "D2 rev") · **#15** → template
accreditation = declared non-goal, authority-local (register
"R6-applied") · **#21** → Sets unaddressable by operations; `sequence`
struck from the set-field whitelist (schema enum + spec D13 row +
appendix-b; register "D21 rev") · **#22** → anticipated-convergence
path scoped pre-1.0 (register "D22 rev 2") · **#23** → `uses-term`
nearest-Set = fewest membership hops, ties ⇒ Portable-tier error
(register "D22-applied rev") · **#25** → op-law completed for
`set-parameter` bounds/tightening + `remove-relation(required)` in
`tailoring_duty_errors` + 6 tailoring vectors (register "D13 rev 3") ·
**#27** → decimal no-leading-zeros + scale-significance clarified
(schema pattern + spec D3 rev) + 2 parameter vectors · **#28** → count
erratum applied (README + spec → 125; recompute via
validate_core.py). Conformance grew 115 → **125 vectors**.
**Partials (stay open above, narrowed):** #20 (schema URI-shape for
`sharpens` awaits the converter rerun), #26 (real pinned
schemas + pin-honoring await the converter rerun). **Still open (delivery pending):**
#12 (`text` primitive — DECIDED 2026-07-22; delivery rides the
converter rerun). Numbering stays stable — closed numbers
are not reused.

**Closed 2026-07-22 (gate 4;** register "Amendments — gate 4" + spec
IV.10): **#18** → both named vector families delivered WITH their
engines — D3.5 composition (`--compose`, highest-minor resolve +
re-validation, 7 vectors) and B.1.8 `conditional-apply` (one-predicate
trigger, one instantiated primitive, normative FAIL format, 8 vectors);
DSSE profile verification live · **#24** → signature verification live
(Ed25519, dependency-free, both implementations): in verification mode
(`--trusted-keys`) an unsigned attestation cannot prove — the P9c-1
forgery closed; 5 dsse vectors. Also delivered against IV.5.4: the
**bidirectional export suite** (10/10 catalog bundles → schema-valid
OSCAL 1.2.2, round-trip **5,647/5,647 objects digest-equal**) and the
**weekend-validator measurement** (`validate_core.ps1`, PowerShell 5.1,
zero installs, 149/149 vectors; ~30× below compliance-trestle's LoC —
see `drafts/gate-4-measurement.md`). Conformance 129 → **149 vectors**
across 12 families.

**Closed 2026-07-22 (gate 3;** register "Amendments — gate 3" + spec
IV.9): **#10** → **DRAINED** (D10 rev 3: an external ODP citation
addresses (requirement, parameter-name) via the DECLARING statement —
measured: no Rev 5 ODP is declared in two statements; the CR26 CTL
overlay's 16 assignments emitted as `set-parameter` ops on the
`rev5-odp-overlay` Tailoring, 14 tailored controls carried in-bundle;
guidance entries stay parked as D20 supplements territory) · **#9
confirmation delivered** (#9-applied: IFA lifecycle corpus mapped with
ZERO enum additions; five lifecycle types at document scale, both
digests — the standing Test-2 gap closed). Gate 3 additionally fixed
two reference-validator defects the corpus exposed (D13 rev 4 tier
anti-laundering; D9 rev 3 multi-select list values) and recorded eight
source findings for upstream. Conformance grew 125 → **129 vectors**;
corpus at HEAD: 11 bundles, 6,675 manifest-listed objects.

**Standing rule for this file:** items enter with counts, leave with
register entries. An item that can neither be evidenced nor closed
after two gate cycles is deleted — backlogs rot like registries do.
